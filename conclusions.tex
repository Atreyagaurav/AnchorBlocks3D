\section{Conclusions}
Here, from section \ref{sec:2d} it can be seen that the trigonometric method of finding forces are easier to implement in 2D calculations, but yield the same result as the ones from Vector method. But apparent advantage of vector method is that it can be scalable to any complex structure as the forces are all in vector format and their resultant can be a simple vector addition. It also supports any additional forces which might be present.

Another advantage of this method comes in analysis, with the presence of vector form of forces and their point of application, the overturning moments along any axis can be calculated instantly. Unlike in traditional method where the designer would make an intellectual guess about which axis the block would be more likely to overturn and check for that axis, here we can check the Factor of Safety against all the axis without significant additional efforts. Making it even more suitable for use in automation.
